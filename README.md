# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly.  The expected behavior is that a div element has a red background, which changes to blue on hover.  However, the styles aren't applied as expected.

## Problem

The provided code includes a div with Tailwind CSS classes `bg-red-500` and `hover:bg-blue-700`. Despite proper setup (assumed), the classes do not produce the anticipated visual effect.  The hover state does not trigger the color change.

## Solution

A potential solution involves verifying the following:

1. **Tailwind Configuration:** Ensure Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) is correctly configured and includes the necessary paths to your CSS files.
2. **CSS Import:** Confirm that the generated Tailwind CSS file is correctly imported into your main CSS file.
3. **Purge Unused Styles (if using):**  If you are using Tailwind's purge feature, ensure that the class names are included in your HTML templates so they aren't purged.
4. **Browser Caching:** Clear your browser's cache or try a different browser to rule out caching issues.
5. **Conflicting Styles:** Check for any conflicting CSS rules that might be overriding Tailwind's styles.
6. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check the spelling and casing of your Tailwind classes for any typos.
7. **Parent Element Styles:**  Ensure that parent elements do not have styles that could inadvertently be affecting the child element.
